    "\n",
    "BigInt can be converted to a number data type, but only through the Number function. \n",
    "\n",
    "This mainly comes as a result of the unary plus operator (```+```) breaking [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/). Asm.js is a subset of JavaScript that is highly optimized. It runs exactly like JavaScript, and can run in both an interpreter, or an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiling engine that can recognize and optimize the subset for speed [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, the unary plus operator is used as syntactic sugar, a shortcut, to convert non-numeric data types into numbers. However, in ASM.js, there's the inclusion of some static type checking, of which, the unary plus operator plays a role in. Simply put, ```+``` tells the browser, or engine, the intended value must be a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, unary plus operators cast upon BigInt values throw an error because the special Asm.js code that depends on ```+``` would break, and given Asm.js being used for performance in applications, this edge case would yield unwanted results.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there still lies an important question; how come the Number function doesn't also throw an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because it's not redefined in Asm.js. Recall, Asm.js is a subset that improves performance, meaning it inherits from JavaScript, except where syntax is redefined. In the case of JavaScript, the explicitly casting aa BigInt value with the Number function does convert the value into a number data type."
