    "JavaScript utilizes a lexicographical order (dictionary order) when comparing strings. If both operands are strings, then the comparison using Unicode is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are compared character-by-character. Interestingly, comparison is based on the Unicode values of the characters being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, if both strings end at the same length, and involve the same characters, they are equal. However, if both strings are equal up until a point, and then one string is terminated, but the rest goes on, the latter is considered greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in ASCII, Unicode points are numeric. So for the first example, when we compare ```a``` to ```A```, ```A``` has a code point of 65, where ```a``` has a code point of 97. In this case, 97 is greater than 65; therefore, ```a``` is greater than ```A```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within Unicode, there are many code points covering a wide variety of modern and historical scripts. Click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) for the ardously long list of characters with their Unicode representation (follow the decimal column).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting note, unicode representations can be made by using the ```\\u``` delimiter within a string. So for example, if I want to represent the number 5, the Unicode representation would be ```\\u0035```."
