    "1. Block scope.\n",

    "\n",
    "Global scope are variables that are declared globally. These should not be created as window variables and functions can be overwritten. This can be done by declaring a variable without ```let```, ```var```, or ```const```.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hoisting** is where variable and function declarations get moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "```var```:\n",
    "- **Scoping:** ```var``` is function scoped. If declared outside any function, ```var``` becomes globally scoped. \n",
    "- **Hoisting**: ```var``` is hoisted to the top of the function and global scope, but not initialized. This means that the variable is accessible throughout the scope, even before the line is declared.\n",
