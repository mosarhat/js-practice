    "# Introduction to JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyle Simpson, in Up and Going, makes a really good point; JS can be used without understanding [1, pg. viii]. However, we should strive to ask why for every concept. This is my personal philosophy for things I have an interest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So within this collection of notebooks, there will be a considerable deep-dive into JavaScript. Sometimes, there will be lines where my thought process is being documented. Sometimes, I go on tangents about un-related topics out of curiosity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is JavaScript?\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a *scripting language* that brings interactivity to the Web, and applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript has full control over updating HTML (through the DOM), and CSS styling. \n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is all the following:\n",
    "- High-level language (highly abstracted).\n",
    "- Dynamically and weakly typed language.\n",
    "- Interpreted language (read line by line).\n",
    "- Multi-paradigm language (object-oriented, functional, imperative, logical, concurrent).\n",
    "- Single-threaded language (executes one task at a time).\n",
    "- Prototype-based language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specification \n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is defined upon [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), which is standardized by ECMA International in [ECMA-262](https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-262_15th_edition_june_2024.pdf) [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, for novice JavaScript developers, ECMAScript is very difficult to understand, however, for the sake of reliability and trustworthiness, the spec is important. I personally also find it very difficult to understand at the time of writing this, so don't be discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "For JavaScript, there exists a group called TC39. TC39 is composed of industry professionals, academics, amongst others. The purpose behind TC39 is to maintain and evolve the definition of JavaScript. Typically, proposals are made, and they follow a flow of approval. Proposals that are considered almost-standard by TC39, are called Stage 3 Proposals.  New proposals to the language are found [here](https://github.com/tc39/proposals). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Editors (IDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Code can generally be written within your typical Notepad on your OS; however, this is highly inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "IDE’s, known as Integrated Development Environments, make it significantly easier to write code. \n",
    "\n",
    "IDEs typically provide the following:\n",
    "- Automatic typo detection.\n",
    "- Syntax highlighting.\n",
    "- Compilation.\n",
    "- Debugging.\n",
    "- Testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of IDE’s; local, and cloud [3].\t\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of this, I'll be using VSCode. I personally like VSCode mainly because the environment is very beginner-friendly, and there's a wide range of extensions that can be downloaded that can deal with a wide range of programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High Level vs Low Level Programming Languages \n",
    "\n",
    "A key term to distinguish high-level programming and low-level programming is *abstraction*.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Robert Martin, author of ***\"Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices\"***, abstraction is the “elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential” [4]. \n",
    "\n",
    "High level programs are abstracted from hardware, and typically already handle memory management. Java, Python, JavaScript are all languages that are highly abstracted, therefore, they are considered high level programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low level programs are not abstracted at all from hardware, and they require manual memory management. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note, languages cannot be strictly classified as either just high level or low level. There is nuance; a middle ground. It’s up to the programmer to choose a language that best suits their requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a high-level language, due to its abstraction from hardware, and no manual memory management. As will be covered later, JavaScript has an automatic garbage collector that is built upon the concept of reachability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following showcases how abstraction dictates whether a language is considered high level, low level, or in-between.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/1/1.jpg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type, and Type Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "A **type** within any programming language is just a **data type** [5]. A data type is a classification that dictates the type of value a variable holds, and the operations that can be done with such a value. This varies across different languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Type conversion** is converting one data type to another data type. For example, converting an integer to a string. There are two types of type conversion; explicit type conversion, and implicit type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implicit type conversion**, or **type coercion**, is handled during code execution. Subsequently, this means that type coercion is a subset of type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicit type conversion**, also known as **type casting**, is manually converting a variable from one data type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a language that includes both explicit, and implicit type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax and Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax** is a *set of rules* that dictate structure. In the case of a programming language, syntax is the set of rules that dictates the structure in which that language is *constructed* [5]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Syntactically, programming languages have different constructs; source text, expressions, statements, declarations, functions and classes, scripts and modules (all found within ECMAScript, sections 12-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of JavaScript, let’s look at the ECMAScript of **if statements** within ECMA-262, in particular, the 14th edition released in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/1/2.jpg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side Note**: I was actually super interested in knowing what ```+In```, ```Yield```, ```Await```, and ```Return``` meant in the language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In JavaScript, the if statement is syntactically correct based upon the use of the following:\n",
    "- A condition where an expression that returns a Boolean value is enclosed within \tparentheses. \n",
    "- A statement. \n",
    "- The use of an else clause isn’t required, but if it is, then there must also be a statement. \n",
    "- Curly brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantics can be defined as the *meaning behind constructs* [5]. Recall, the **if statement** within ECMA-262. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is an else clause, the semantics would be:\n",
    "- The condition is executed. \n",
    "- If the condition is true, the body of the statement is executed.\n",
    "- If the condition is false, the body of the statement is not executed, but the else clause is \texecuted. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "Type checking is an algorithmic check to see if a program within a programming language respects its own syntax. There are two types of type checking; static, and dynamic type checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a static type checker, type checking occurs within the static context, which is compile time [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of static type checking include early error detection, improved performance as type checks are not made at runtime, and consistent code, and code reliability. The disadvantages of static type checking include the added verbosity it introduces, extended development time for pre-defining types [7][8].\n",
    "\n",
    "In a dynamic type checker, type checking occurs within the dynamic context, which is at runtime [6].\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of static type checking include added flexibility since type declaration is not required, and ease of use due to the lack of verbosity in code. On the other hand, dynamic type checking introduces risk of runtime error, and a reduction in code reliability [7][8].\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, static type checking is far more reliable and due to types not being checked within the dynamic context, i.e., at runtime, performance is much quicker than that of dynamic type checking. However, dynamic type checking involves far less verbosity due to the lack of pre-defining types, and it’s much easier for the development process as it is flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Systems (Statically vs Dynamically Typed Languages)\n",
    "\n",
    "A type system is generally made of types, which are (recall from previous slides) data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two important type systems; statically, and dynamically-typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statically typed languages perform static type checking, which is done in the static context, i.e., at compile time. Recall, static typing is advantageous because it allows for code consistency, allows for bugs to be caught earlier, and greater code reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamically typed languages perform dynamic type checking, which is done in the dynamic context, i.e., at runtime. Dynamically typed languages involve far less verbosity as pre-defined typing isn’t required, and it’s must easier for the development process as it is flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weakly Typed vs Strongly Typed\n",
    "\n",
    "Type conversion can generally dictate whether a language is considered weakly typed or strongly typed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weakly typed languages allows for type coercion (implicit type conversion), and it does so aggressively without type casting. Type coercion is done automatically and can lead to unexpected behaviour, as it does not care about the outcome. Weakly typed languages do allow for explicit type casting [9].\n",
    "\n",
    "Strongly typed language do not allow for implicit conversion, but they do allow for type casting (explicit type conversion).\n",
    "JavaScript is a weakly typed language.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note, TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript is a strong typed language that does not allow for any type coercion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of a basic type coercion that involves implicit conversion, showcasing the weak typing within JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(5 + \"5\"); // return 55 (strings have a higher order of precedence)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, within Python, a strongly typed language, this would render a TypeError:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(5 + \"5\") # TypeError; cannot add int + str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Oriented Programming, and Their Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two subtypes of object-oriented programming; class-based (also known as closed based), and prototype-based programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Class-based programs have objects created from classes as instances of such classes:\n",
    "- They serve as a blueprint for creating objects (involves init, getters, setters, methods, etc.).\n",
    "- Supports abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "- The structure is locked after class definition. You cannot change class initialization properties after the fact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prototype-based programs have objects inherit from other objects:\n",
    "- Everything is an object. There is no class blueprint.\n",
    "- Extends existing objects.\n",
    "- Behaviour can be changed dynamically. \n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is considered as a *prototype-based* language. Simply put, this means that objects in JavaScript can inherit properties from other objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming Language Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a very basic diagram (to make it easier to remember) for compilers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/1/2.svg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Compiling Source Code</figcaption>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "With a compiler language, the source code is compiled into an executable machine code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled code is immediately ready to run (really fast). It is easily optimized for a CPU. Source code is private as the only thing being compiled is the executable machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled code is not cross-platform, as the executable file on a Windows computer won't work on a Mac -- it is very platform dependent. Source code is also hidden as only the compiled executable machine code file is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of compiler languages:\n",
    "- C.\n",
    "- C++.\n",
    "- Rust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreters\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a very basic diagram (to make it easier to remember) for interpreted languages at run-time: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/1/3.svg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Interpreting Source Code</figcaption>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Within an interpreter, source code isn’t compiled beforehand. Interpreters work on the fly and execute line-by-line. This causes it to be much slower than compiler-based languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages also do not save as machine code file, so there isn’t any executables. This proves to be advantageous because interpreted languages are cross-platform, and it allows for easier debugging because we have access to the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of interpreted languages:\n",
    "- JavaScript (modern JS engines use JIT, will be discussed).\n",
    "- PHP.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript engines that are modern have moved away from this model of compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JIT\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the compiler, where all the work done up-front, and the interpreter where all the work is done on the receiving end, we can do a bit of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "JIT utilizes a compilation to an intermediate language, which is portable (non-platform dependent) but as close to machine code as possible. It is then distributed, and when it’s run, it takes it to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transpilers\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a very basic diagram for transpilers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/1/4.svg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Transpiling Source Code</figcaption>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "A transpiler is a compiler that transforms and compiles code. There are various uses of transpilers:\n",
    "- Babel (transpiles ES6+ into ES5, React uses Babel to transpile JSX to ES6).\n",
    "- Traceur (transpiles everything after ES6 into ES5).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the use cases above, transpilers aid in converting code in newer syntax into code that can be used in older environments. The use of newer syntax allows for better readability and maintainability. This particularly useful for web development (although, Polyfills, which will be discussed later, serve that purpose nicely).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Languages Transpiled to JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeScript transpiles to JavaScript which is then compiled at run-time (i.e., interpreted).\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeScript’s transpiler checks types and syntax, and transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, where no machine code is produced. Notice how this is different than C, and Java, where programs are automatically compiled to executable machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are an excess of languages that are transpiled to JavaScript. The following are some of those languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Static type checker for JavaScript. Allows for static data typing.\n",
    "- [Flow](https://flow.org/): Static type checker for JavaScript. Not really used much.\n",
    "- [Dart](https://dart.dev/): A new language. Not used much. Compiles to JavaScript through a transpiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something interesting to note, TypeScript makes JS mimic a compiled language by introducing static typing.\n",
    "\n",
