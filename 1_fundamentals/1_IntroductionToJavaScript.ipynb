    "# Introduction to JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "Kyle Simpson, in Up and Going, makes a really good point; JS can be used without understanding [1, pg. viii]. However, we should strive to ask why for every concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "So within this collection of notebooks, there will be a considerable deep-dive into JavaScript. Sometimes, there will be lines where my thought process is being documented. I want to understand this language better than my mother tongue, quite literally (LOL).\n",
    "\n",
    "## High Level vs Low Level Programming Languages \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of programs in terms of their level on a spectrum based on abstraction, and their degrees of separation from hardware:\n",
    "- High level program. Abstracted from hardware. Typically handles memory management.\n",
    "    - Examples:\n",
    "        - Python.\n",
    "        - Java.\n",
    "        - JavaScript.\n",
    "- Low level program. Not abstracted at all, and requires memory management that is manual.\n",
    "    - Example:\n",
    "        - Assembly.\n",
    "        - Machine Code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn't strictly one or the other; high or low. There is a middle ground, and that's up to the programmer to understand the differences between a variety of languages, and what best suits their requirements.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Where JavaScript Fits Into The Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript is a *high-level programming* language that can be used to add interactivity to web pages. JS has a significantly smaller emphasis on classes (provided only for syntactic sugar) [2]. Simply put, objects are inherited from other objects. JavaScript has a garbage collector (will be covered later on).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Types are just \"data types\". A data type is a classification that dictates the type of value a variable holds, and the operations that can be done with such value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type conversion is converting one type to another (LOL). Type conversion falls under two categories; implicit type conversion (done during code execution), or explicit type conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit type conversion is just quite literally a fancy way of saying type coercion (will be covered super in-depth later on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit type conversion, known as type casting, is manually converting a variable from one data type to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type conversion can dictate whether or not a language is considered weakly typed, or strongly typed:\n",
    "- Weakly typed languages.\n",
    "    - Allow for implicit conversion (i.e. type coercion) aggressively. It does not care about errors at all [3].\n",
    "    - Note: Just because a language is weakly typed, does not mean that it doesn't have the ability to evoke type casting. Interestingly, languages that are weakly typed are more about how that specific language performs behavior wise when type casting is not used.\n",
    "- Strongly typed languages.\n",
    "    - Do not allow implicit conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a variety of type systems:\n",
    "- Static typing. Determined by whether or not the type of the variable is known at compile time [4]. Static typing is advantageous because it allows code to be more consistent, and allows for bugs to be caught earlier on. \n",
    "    - Simple: Type checking at compile time.\n",
    "- Dynamic typing. Variables can hold different typed values, i.e. runtime values [4]. \n",
    "    - Simple. Type checking at run time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of a basic type coercion that involves implicit conversion, showcasing the weak typing within JavaScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(5 + \"5\"); // return 55 (strings have a higher order of precedence)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, within Python, a strongly typed language, this would render a TypeError:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(5 + \"5\") # TypeError; cannot add int + str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where JavaScript Fits Into The Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is also *dynamically typed*, meaning that variables are determined at runtime, rather than at compile time. As JavaScript is not statically typed, typically, it is considered as a weakly typed (recall this just means implicit conversion will be run aggressively) language; however, type casting does exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, this isn't the case with TypeScript, as it is statically typed, and compiles at compile time. However, because it is a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript can also allow for implicit conversion for certain operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Object Oriented Programming, and Their Types\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are subtypes of Object Oriented Programming:\n",
    "- Class-Based. Also sometimes referred to as Closed-Based. Objects are created from classes as instances of such classes.\n",
    "    - A blueprint for creating objects (init, getters, setters, methods, etc.).\n",
    "    - Supports very important concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
    "    - Structure is locked after class definition. \n",
    "    - Examples:\n",
    "        - Java, C++, Python, C#, Swift, Kotlin, among many more.\n",
    "- Prototype-Based. Objects inherit from other objects. \n",
    "    - Everything is an object. There is no class blueprint. Simply, objects are clones of other objects.\n",
    "    - Extend existing objects.\n",
    "    - Behavior can be changed dynamically.\n",
    "    - Examples:\n",
    "        - JavaScript, Self, Lua, among many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where JavaScript Fits Into The Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is considered as a *prototype-based* language. Simply put, this means that objects in JavaScript can inherit properties from other objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "In languages like Java or C++, which are class-based languages, they use classes, and do not allow object-to-object inheritance. They are also compile time programming languages, so they require a predefined structure, i.e. classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note, in Java, we can use a prototype-like approach. Odd, right? This does not mean Java is prototype-based, it just means that it can simulate prototypes with a class-based system; they copt the base object, and override a few properties. This is done to avoid deep class hierarchies, and allow for flexible adjustments. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming Language Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilers\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a very basic diagram (to make it easier to remember) for compilers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/3.svg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Compiling Source Code</figcaption>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "With a compiler language, the source code is compiled into an executable machine code file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled code is immediately ready to run (really fast). It is easily optimized for a CPU. Source code is private as the only thing being compiled is the executable machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled code is not cross-platform, as the executable file on a Windows computer won't work on a Mac -- it is very platform dependent. Source code is also hidden as only the compiled executable machine code file is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of compiler languages:\n",
    "- C.\n",
    "- C++.\n",
    "- Rust.\n",
    "- Objective-C.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreters\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a very basic diagram (to make it easier to remember) for interpreted languages at run-time: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/4.svg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Interpreting Source Code</figcaption>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "With an interpreted language, source code isn't compiled beforehand. Interpreters work on the fly, and go line-by-line, and process on the spot; this causes it to be slower than a simple compiler. It is not saved as a machine code file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted code is cross-platform; machine code is not provided, so it doesn't matter what operating system we are working out of. Much easier to debug, as we have access to the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted code involves an interpreter, is slower, and often public. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of interpreted languages:\n",
    "- JavaScript (modern JS engines use JIT now).\n",
    "- PHP.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript engines that are modern have moved away from this model of compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JIT\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of the compile model where all the work is done up-front, or the interpreted model where all the work is done on the receiving end, we can do a bit of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compile to an intermediate language, which is portable but as close to machine code as possible. This is then distributed, and when it's run, it takes it to machine code. This is referred to as JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transpilers (Irrelevant, Yet Important)\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeScript transpiles (transforms + compiles) to JavaScript which then is compiled at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a very basic diagram for transpilers:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"assets/6.svg\" width=\"40%\"></img>\n",
    "    <figcaption>Transpiling Source Code</figcaption>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeScript's transpiler checks types and syntax, transforms TypeScript into JavaScript, and no machine code is produced. Essentially, TypeScript performs a transformation, then type checks, and this is compile timed as the type checking is done in compile time. Notice, this isn't compile timed like C or Rust, which automatically compiles to machine code.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are an excess of languages that are transpiled to JavaScript. The following are some of those languages:\n",
    "- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) allows for strict data types.\n",
    "- [Flow](https://flow.org/) is a static type checker for JavaScript. Not used often.\n",
    "- [Dart](https://dart.dev/) - A new language, as a competitor to JS. Not used often. It compiles to JS through a transpiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something interesting to note, TypeScript makes JS mimic a compiled language by introducing static typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where JavaScript Fits Into The Picture\n",
    "JavaScript is also an *interpreted* language. Interpreted languages translate and execute code line by line without compiling it to machine language first. However, most modern JavaScript engines utilize JIT compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript can execute both in the command line interface and in the browser. Within the browser, an embedded engine is used. Browsers tend to have different engines. Within the command line interface, ```node`` is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- Chrome, Brave, Opera and Edge use V8. \n",
    "- Firefox uses SpiderMonkey.\n",
    "- Safari uses WebKit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Understanding of JavaScript Compilation (will improve after CISC 458)\n",
    "\n",
    "JavaScript is *synchronous* (moves to the next line when the execution of the current line). JavaScript is also *single-threaded* (executes one command at a time in a specific order).\n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to compiling JavaScript, the following is a great diagram that showcases what a JavaScript Engine looks like (from freeCodeCamp):\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "    <img src=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2023/05/09BA18A6-3F7A-4DBE-AA43-C482725CA5E4.jpeg\"></img>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The call stack is where JavaScript is executed. The heap is where the objects required are stored. CPU's can only process binary, so the code has to be translated to machine code (binary representation) [7]. When code passes into the engine, the code is parsed. The code is parsed to a data structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This is then used to create machine code [7]."
